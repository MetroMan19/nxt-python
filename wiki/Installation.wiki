=Installation Instructions=

==Linux==

You will need a recent 2.x version of Python, most systems already have this installed. However, as more distributions move to 3.x (which is not compatible with nxt-python), you may need to install a 2.x version in addition using your package manager.

Open a terminal window, and use the `svn checkout http://nxt-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nxt-python` command to download the source. Run `cd nxt-python` to move to the directory that you put it in. Then, as root (e.g. sudo) run `python setup.py install`. If the word ‘error’ is not anywhere in the text that is printed, then great. If it is, then follow the error instructions to resolve the issue (or ask about it at the [http://groups.google.com/group/nxt-python mailing list], and we'll try to help you out). 

            For USB communications, download and install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/ PyUSB] according to the instructions included in it. (Note: This next step may not be necessary on some newer systems which give any user control over USB devices by default, but it can't hurt and is therefore recommended) As root, run the command `groupadd lego`, then `usermod –a –G lego <username>` (where `<username>` is the name of the user account that you will be using to program your NXT). Then make a file at /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules containing exactly (note that after this you will need to log out and then back in and then restart udev or your whole system): 
{{{
BUS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
}}}

            For Bluetooth communications, install [http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/downloads/list PyBluez], or on debian-based systems, you can just run (as root) `apt-get install python-bluez`. You will also need a compatible Bluetooth dongle, if your computer doesn’t already support Bluetooth.

==Windows==

You will need Python 2.x (NOT 3.x), the newer the better. Older versions may have problems.

Install [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortiseSVN]. Create a new folder somewhere and call it something meaningful, like "nxt-python". Right click on the folder and click SVN Checkout. Copy and Paste "http://nxt-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" to the top text box and click OK. After it finishes, double click on the folder to open it. Then double click on install.bat. If a black window appears, flashes some data, then disappears, it worked. If it doesn't disappear, follow the instructions on the screen.

            For USB communications, you need to install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/ PyUSB].

            For Bluetooth communications, download and install [http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/downloads/list PyBluez]. You will also need a compatible Bluetooth dongle, if your computer doesn’t already support Bluetooth.

==Mac==

To use NXT-Python on Mac, you will need Python 2.4 or higher (but not 3.x).

Make sure you have [http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/software/ PyObjC] installed; this comes preinstalled with Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) and anything newer, but if you have an earlier version of OS X you will need to install it yourself. Then, install [http://lightblue.sourceforge.net/ LightBlue], a Bluetooth library for Mac (USB is currently not supported and will not work, as far as I know, though you're welcome to experiment).

Download nxt-python from the svn with `svn checkout http://nxt-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nxt-python` in a terminal or by fetching and extracting the latest source package from the downloads page. Open a terminal, move to the nxt-python directory using `cd nxt-python`, and run `python setup.py install`. To test the installation, run one of the programs in the examples directory

Note: This guide only works with versions 1.2.0, trunk r109, or branches/v2 r164 or greater (excluding v2.0 betas 0 and 1).

===What if I already have !LightBlue Glue installed with an older version of nxt-python or NXT_Python?===

If you have an existing [http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/software/nxt_lightblue_glue/ LightBlue Glue] setup, you can update by doing the following:

Follow the instructions above. After doing that, remove your bluetooth.py directory (~/nxt_lightblue_glue in the setup example) and the PYTHONPATH line to that you added to your .profile or .bashrc.

Note that if you do not delete the bluetooth.py directory or PYTHONPATH enrty, NXT-Python _should_ still work fine, it will just use the external !LightBlue Glue instead of the new internal one.

=Then What?=

Now that you have successfully installed NXT_python and one or both of the communication drivers (USB or Bluetooth), you can start using your nxt brick.

See [http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/wiki/Tutorial the tutorial page] or the examples in the examples folder for usage instructions.
