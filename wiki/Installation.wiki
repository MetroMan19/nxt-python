=Installation Instructions=

==Linux==

Note: This guide assumes basic knowledge terminal commands.

Use the svn command to download the source. Open a terminal window, and cd to the directory that you put it in. Then type “python setup.py install” and press enter. If the word ‘error’ is not anywhere in the text that is printed, then great. If it is, then follow the error instructions to resolve the issue. 

            For USB communications, download and install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/ PyUSB] according to the instructions included in it. Run the command “sudo gorupadd lego”, then “sudo usermod –a –G lego username” (where username is the name of the user account that you will be using to program your NXT). Then make a file at /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules containing exactly: 
{{{
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
}}}
            Note: You will need root (sudo) priveliges to do this.

            For Bluetooth communications, download and install (according to instructions included in the package) [http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/downloads/list PyBluez]. You will also need a compatible Bluetooth dongle, if your computer doesn’t already support Bluetooth.

==Windows==

Install [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortiseSVN]. Create a new folder somewhere and call it something meaningful, like "nxt-python". Right click on the folder and click SVN Checkout. Copy and Paste "http://nxt-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" to the top text box and click OK. After it finishes, double click on the folder to open it. Then double click on install.bat. If a black window appears, flashes some data, then disappears, it worked. If it doesn't disappear, follow the instructions on the screen.

            For USB communications, you need to install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/ PyUSB]. An PyUSB executable installer for Python 2.6 (compiled by me!) is available [http://nxt-python.googlecode.com/files/pyusb-0.4.1.win32-py2.6.exe here].

            For Bluetooth communications, download and install [http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/downloads/list PyBluez]. You will also need a compatible Bluetooth dongle, if your computer doesn’t already support Bluetooth.

==Mac==

I have not tested this on Mac, though it is reported to work, except that instead of pybluez, you would install the python lightblue glue package.

=Then What?=

Now that you have successfully installed NXT_python and one or both of the communication drivers, you can start using your nxt brick.

See [http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/wiki/Documentation the documentation page] or the examples in the examples folder for usage instructions.
