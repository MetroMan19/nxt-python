=How can I control motors while reading sensor inputs?=
Using v2.1.x+ (or the latest SVN), use the thread module to run multiple threads, one for each thing which you want to do simultaneously. This is complex, but a good example of one way of doing this can be found in the examples directory and is called cnc.py. If you must use an older version of NXT-Python, a patch to allow multiple threads can be found at [http://groups.google.com/group/nxt-python/browse_thread/thread/db9fa1da34c4d103 this thread] on the mailing list.
